* the reason behind the project
- i should gather all my thoughts
  show the thought i currently holding in my head, how thoughts evolved, and the incident which caused the change
- `first thoughts' are pulse, `second thoughts' are rational. i can't hold both thoughts in my head at the same time, maybe i should use a buffer outside my head to get rid of the first thoughts
- a good tool can help me record my thoughts
