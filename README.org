* how to implement
not sure
** keywords
- whole thought
  + current thought
  + old thought
- incident
- hide indicator

** structure
#+begin_quote
current thought
<-incident
[old thought
<-incident]...
BLANK LINES
#+end_quote
incident could have chars like _ to make the editor underline the incident (not sure)

#+begin_quote
current thought
<-incident[...]
[old thought
<-incident]...[...]
[old thought
<-incident]
BLANK LINES
#+end_quote

** how to add thoughts
use two seperate function
- `add new thought to current thought'
- `add new thought

readin the thought & incident, and move the whole thought to the front of the file

** how to hide old thoughts
*** to show everything in one file, and use editors `hiding block' feature to clear away old thoughts
- easy git management

*** use a program to manage the pure text file's content, and sending commands to program to get old thoughts
- need way to export and inport data
  
** how to only show precise level of old thoughts
one tab on the level shows one level, one shift tab hides all
** how to manage `multiple incident to one thought'
- no special treatment
  #+begin_quote
happy <-_reading_- happy <-_gaming_-
  #+end_quote

** incident could be a long story, maybe need to be paragraph
not sure

maybe wouldn't happen

* the reason behind the project
- i should gather all my thoughts
  
  show the thought i currently holding in my head, how thoughts evolved, and the incident which caused the change
  
- `first thoughts' are pulse, `second thoughts' are rational. i can't hold both thoughts in my head at the same time, maybe i should use a buffer outside my head to get rid of the first thoughts
  
- a good tool can help me record my thoughts

- maybe its just another presentation of diary
